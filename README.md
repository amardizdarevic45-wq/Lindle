- 💬 **Live Contract Chat** – ask questions directly about your contract in plain language.  
- 📂 **Personal Clause/Contract Vault** – save your preferred clauses for reuse in future negotiations and store your contracts.  
- ⏰ **Smart Reminders** – get nudges for deadlines, renewals, or unpaid invoices linked to contracts.  
- 🤝 **Reputation Tracker** – keep a history of past clients/vendors with contract outcomes.  
- 📊 **Insights Dashboard** – visualize risk exposure and negotiation wins across contracts.
